Installation

# Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, you need to clone the project repository onto your local machine.
Run the following command in your terminal:

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-directory>

# Step 2: Install Dependencies

Now, install all the required dependencies by running this command:
npm install
This will download and set up all the necessary packages.

## Running the Project

# Step 3: Start the Development Server

To run the project locally, use the following command to start the development server:

npm run dev

By default, the server will run on http://localhost:5173/, but Vite may pick another port if that one is occupied. Youâ€™ll see the URL in the terminal.

# Step 4: Build for Production

When you are ready to create a production build, use this command:

npm run build
This will generate the production files in the dist folder.
Previewing the Build

# Step 5: Preview the Production Build

To view the production build locally, use the following command:

npm run preview
It will start a local static server to preview the build.
Linting

# Step 6: Run Linter

To maintain code quality, run the linter using this command:

npm run lint
This will check your project for any code issues or warnings based on your linting configuration.

Additional Information
This project is built using Vite and React.
It uses react-router-dom for routing, chart.js for data visualization, and other dependencies as listed in the package.json file.
The entry point of the project is the index.html file located in the root directory, and React components are located in the src folder.
This structure will make your README file easy to read and well-organized for anyone using your project. Just replace <your-repo-url> with the actual repository URL when you write the file.
